# Step 1: Analysis – Problem, Inputs/Outputs, and Context

##  Restated Problem

The goal is to design a simple, logic-based system that controls the gates at a railway crossing. The system must lower the gates when a train is coming or if a vehicle is still on the track, and only raise the gates when it is completely safe.

##  Inputs and  Outputs

**Inputs:**
- **Train Approaching** – Detects if a train is coming (Yes/No)
- **Vehicle on Track** – Detects if a vehicle is still on the tracks (Yes/No)

**Output:**
- **Gate Position** – The system's action to either lower or raise the gate (Lowered/Raised)

##  Context and Constraints

**Context:**  
This system is for public railway crossings where vehicles and people may cross tracks. It must prevent accidents and keep traffic moving safely.

**Constraints:**
- **Technical:** Must use simple logic and basic sensors
- **Economic:** Should be affordable to install and maintain
- **Social:** Needs to protect lives and avoid long delays
- **Environmental:** Should use energy efficiently
- **Legal:** Must follow railway and road safety laws

##  Stakeholders

- Drivers and pedestrians
- Train operators
- Engineers and system designers
- Emergency services
- Government and safety authorities
