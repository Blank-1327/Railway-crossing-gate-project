##  Project Overview

The aim of this project is to design a logic-based safety system for a railway level crossing.  
The system uses simple logic steps to control when the gate should lower or raise based on sensor inputs.

##  Steps of the Engineering Method

The project follows 7 structured steps:

| Step | Description                                 | Folder |
|------|---------------------------------------------|--------|
| 1    | Problem analysis and defining requirements  | `/Step1_Analysis` |
| 2    | Brainstorming solutions and real-world example | `/Step2_Alternatives` |
| 3    | Choosing the best solution based on safety and simplicity | `/Step3_Logic_Choice` |
| 4    | Writing the system logic in plain English    | `/Step4_Plain_English` |
| 5    | Flowchart of the logic                       | `/Step5_Flowchart` |
| 6    | Testing with input combinations + improvements | `/Step6_Testing` |
