# Step 3: Evaluating Alternatives + Engineering Decision

##  Chosen Solution: Solution 2 â€“ Sensor-Based Priority System

After comparing both options, I chose **Solution 2** because it is safer and more reliable.

---

##  Justification

- **Simplicity:**  
  It is still easy to understand even though it uses more detailed logic than Solution 1.

- **Safety:**  
  Solution 2 includes a delay before raising the gate and double-checks the track, which adds more protection.

- **Reliability:**  
  This system works better in real-life situations, especially where vehicles may take time to fully clear the tracks.

 Final Decision:  
Solution 2 is the better option because it makes the system safer while remaining practical and easy to apply.

Solution 2: Sensor-Based Priority System 

Use separate sensors for detecting: 

Train approach (distance-based) 

Vehicle entry and exit at the crossing (pressure or motion sensors) 

Logic: 

If a train is detected within a certain range, start a countdown to lower the gate. 

If a vehicle is still detected during countdown, hold the gate until it leaves. 

Once both train has passed and track is clear, raise the gate. 

Adds safety delay and improves reliability in busy areas.
