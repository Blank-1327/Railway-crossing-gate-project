# Step 2: Exploring Alternatives

##  Two Logic-Based Solutions

###  Solution 1: Basic Logic System
- If a train is approaching **OR** a vehicle is on the tracks → Lower the gate.
- If there is **no train** AND **no vehicle** on the track → Raise the gate.
- This solution is very simple and easy to implement.

###  Solution 2: Sensor-Based Priority System
- Sensors detect trains and vehicles separately.
- If a train is approaching, the gate lowers immediately.
- If a vehicle is still on the track, the gate stays lowered.
- Once both train and vehicle are gone, a **short delay** occurs before raising the gate.
- This adds extra safety and avoids raising the gate too soon.

##  Real-World Example (Germany)

In Germany, railway crossings use automated systems with sensors and counters. They detect trains early and lower gates before the train arrives. Other sensors check for vehicles or people on the tracks. If anything is detected, the train can be slowed or stopped. Once the train has passed and the area is clear, the gates rise. This system is fully automatic and helps improve safety and traffic flow.
