this test shows that the gate will only open if the train is not detected within 50m and a vehicle is not passing. And also, the gate will not be open if the train is passing.

## ðŸ”§ Suggested Improvements

1. **Adjustable Delay Time** â€“ Let the delay before raising the gate be customizable.
2. **Pedestrian Detection** â€“ Add sensors for people, not just vehicles.
3. **Manual Override** â€“ Include an emergency manual control switch.
4. **Visual and Audio Alerts** â€“ Add lights and sound alerts before the gate moves.

âœ… These improvements would make the system even safer and more flexible in real-world use.
