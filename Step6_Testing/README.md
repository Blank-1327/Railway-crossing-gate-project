| Test Case | Train Approaching | Vehicle on Track | Expected Output                      | Actual Output                        |
|-----------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| 1         | Yes               | Yes              | Lower the gate                        | Lower the gate                        |
| 2         | Yes               | No               | Lower the gate                        | Lower the gate                        |
| 3         | No                | Yes              | Keep gate lowered                     | Keep gate lowered                     |
| 4         | No                | No               | Wait â†’ Check again â†’ Raise the gate  | Wait â†’ Check again â†’ Raise the gate  |

âœ… All actual results match the expected outputs.

## ðŸ”§ Suggested Improvements

1. **Adjustable Delay Time** â€“ Let the delay before raising the gate be customizable.
2. **Pedestrian Detection** â€“ Add sensors for people, not just vehicles.
3. **Manual Override** â€“ Include an emergency manual control switch.
4. **Visual and Audio Alerts** â€“ Add lights and sound alerts before the gate moves.

âœ… These improvements would make the system even safer and more flexible in real-world use.
